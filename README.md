# FakeLibrary
FakeLibrary to test typings definition for TypeScript 2.0.

I create it to test the generation of the declaration file and try to include it directly in my project [FakeLibraryConsumer](https://github.com/MasGaNo/FakeLibraryConsumer) without to declare the declaration file or to publish it to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/definitelytyped.github.io) repository (if I need to keep some internal private library, I don't want to publish their definition files to public).
